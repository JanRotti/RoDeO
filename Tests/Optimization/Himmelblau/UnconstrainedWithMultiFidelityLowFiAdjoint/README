In this example, the Himmelblau test function is minimized without any constraint. The Himmelblau
function is given as

f(x1,x2) = (x1^2+x2-11.0)^2 + (x1+x2^2-7.0)^2

It has four identical local minima

f(3.0,2.0) = 0.0
f(-2.805118, 3.131312) = 0.0
f(-3.779319, -3.283186) = 0.0
f(3.584428, -1.848126) = 0.0


The box constraints for x1 and x2 are given as

-6.0 < x1 < 6.0
-6.0 < x2 < 6.0


The Himmelblau function is implemented in the c-file "himmelblau.cpp" and writes the output to 
a file "objFunVal.dat". The low-fidelity adjoint model for the same function is implemented in the c-file
"himmelblauAdjointLowFi.cpp". This function evaluates the Himmelblau function with an error, as well as the gradient vector of the low-fidelity function. It 
writes its ouput to the file: "objFunValLowFi.dat".   The settings for the optimization can be found in
the configuration file "himmelblau.cfg".

To run the test case, run the python file "runOptimization.py" in terminal: python runOptimization.py

# RoDeO
RoDeo (Robust Design Optimization Package) is a package for simulation based global design optimization. It is specifically designed
for scientific/engineering applications, in which the objective function and constraints are evaluated by computationally expensive simulations. 

Features of the RoDeO Package:
- Surrogate model based Efficient Global Optimization (EGO) strategy
- Full data-driven approach
- Easy and efficient treatment of inequality constraints
- Gradient and tangent enhaced surrogate modeling 
 
 
Build Support

External Libraries
 - RoDeO uses the linear algebra library Armadillo. Therefore, before compiling RoDeO sources, Armadillo must be installed in the system.
